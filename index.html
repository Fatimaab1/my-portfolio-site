    <section class="aboutme" id="about-me">
        <h2 class="about-heading">About Me</h2>
        <p class="content">I am a highly motivated individual with a strong passion for web development, who
            constantly seeks new challenges to further develop my skills. Over the past year, I have honed my skills
            through a variety of methods, including online courses, workshops, mentorship programs, and personal
            projects. I have a deep appreciation for the power of web design and development to seamlessly blend form
            and function, and I am driven to create websites that exceed expectations.
            <br>
            <br> I am constantly striving to expand my knowledge and skills, recognising the importance of staying
            up-to-date
            with the latest trends and developments in the field. To achieve this, I actively seek out new opportunities
            to learn and grow, whether it be through attending webinars or participating in online communities.
            <br>
            <br> In my free time, I enjoy experimenting with new design elements and exploring different web development
            technologies. Additionally, I love connecting with other developers online to learn from their experiences
            and gain new perspectives.
            Beyond my technical skills, I possess a strong ability to communicate effectively and collaborate with
            others, which has been essential in my past experiences working on team projects. My ultimate goal is to
            become a well-rounded web developer, and I am excited to see where this journey will take me.

        <h3>My Interest In Applying To The Program</h3>
        <p class="content text2"> <span id="dots">...</span>
            <span id="hidden-text">
                I am interested in applying to the Founders and Coders bootcamp because of my strong passion for
                coding
                and
                my desire to learn and grow. Through various personal projects and online courses, I have been drawn to
                the
                creativity and problem-solving aspects of coding. However, I believe that the Founders and Coders
                bootcamp
                can provide me with a more immersive and collaborative learning experience, which will enable me to
                further
                develop my skills.
                <br>
                <br> The community aspect of the program is particularly appealing to me, and I am eager to work
                alongside
                other
                like-minded individuals who can help me learn and grow. Having spoken to previous Founders and Coders
                students who highly recommended the program, I am especially drawn to the unique learning experience
                that
                emphasises collaboration.
                <br>
                <br> Additionally, I am excited about the apprenticeship component of the program, as I believe it will
                give
                me
                the opportunity to gain hands-on experience working on real-world projects. This experience will be
                invaluable in preparing me for a successful career as a developer.
                Overall, I am highly committed to putting in the time and effort required to succeed in the bootcamp and
                apprenticeship. I strongly believe that this program can help me achieve my personal and professional
                goals,
                and I am eager to contribute to and learn from the supportive community at Founders and Coders.

        <h2 class="webdev-heading">Discovering My Passion for Web Development</h2>
        <p class="webdev-paragraph">I am drawn to a career in web development because it aligns with my personal
            interests and passions. I have always enjoyed finding creative solutions to problems, and web development
            provides the perfect outlet for combining my creativity with technical skills. I vividly remember the moment
            when I wrote my first line of code and saw my project concept come to life. Ever since then, I've spent
            countless hours learning web development, honing my coding skills, and building projects that excite me.
            That moment sparked a deep passion for web development within me and ignited my desire to pursue it as a
            career.
            <br>
            <br> In addition to my passion for web development, I have a love for baking. Through this, I've come to
            appreciate the creative process that goes into creating something from scratch. Similarly, web development
            allows me to utilise my technical skills while also tapping into my creative side to build visually
            appealing and functional websites. It's like baking a cake, where you follow the recipe (the code) and add
            your own personal touch (the design) to create something unique and special. I believe that my love for
            baking has taught me valuable skills that are transferable to web development. Such as, problem-solving,
            adaptability, and attention to detail, which are all critical traits needed in the field of web development.
            <br>
            <br> Moreover, my personal goal has always been to make a positive impact on others, and I believe pursuing
            a
            career in web development will enable me to achieve this. I am captivated by how websites can connect people
            and make information easily accessible from anywhere in the world. With a passion for technology and its
            potential to improve lives, I see web development as the ideal opportunity to merge my interests and create
            a significant impact.
